# NOTE: This version is a placeholder!
# The version is automatically generated by poetry-dynamic-versioning
# to include the commit hash. To change the version of the package,
# create a git tag for a commit available on the main branch instead!
# For example:
#   git tag vX.Y.Z <commit-hash>
# The tag must then be pushed to the corresponding remote:
#   git push origin tag vX.Y.Z
# The resulting version will then be: X.Y.Z+HASH
# Do not tag commits in side branches! Tags do not follow commits,
# and modifying any commits in a development branch will not update
# the tag. Only create tags for commits that won't be modified
# anymore (i.e, main branch).
